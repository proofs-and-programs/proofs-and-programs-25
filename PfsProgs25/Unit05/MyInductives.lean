# Inductive types for numbers, data, propositions.

What makes the foundations we use work are that the mathematical objects we need as well as their properties can be constructed in terms of inductive types and dependent function types. Similarly, proofs and terms need only a few rules to be constructed.

We will see how to define inductive types and how to define functions by recursion on these types.
